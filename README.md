**ABOUT**

This project uses mesonbuild and builds bgfx, bimg and bx through git submodules. SDL2 is a static library that has been prebuilt and added to the project.

shadercDebug.exe was compiled and taken from the BGFX project. It doesn't work well with anything but DirectX11 and OpenGL so be careful.
